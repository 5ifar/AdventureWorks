# ðŸš² AdventureWorks
This repository serves as my documentation for the AdventureWorks Project.
It was created as a self-learning project for the Udemy course: [Microsoft Power BI Desktop for Business Intelligence](https://www.udemy.com/course/microsoft-power-bi-up-running-with-power-bi-desktop/) by Maven Analytics.

It showcases my competancy with the Microsoft Power BI Desktop application and demonstrates my proficiency in essential Power BI concepts like Data Profiling, ETL with Power Query, Semantic Data Modelling, DAX Measures & DAX Calculated Columns, Dashboard Designing, Visualization, Conditional Formating, Filters, Bookmarks, Page Navigation, Parameters, Custom Tooltips, User Roles, Publishing and Report Optimization etc.

The AdventureWorks Project Report has been created using Microsoft Power BI Desktop 2.128.751.0 and published on Microsoft Power BI Service.

A special thanks to [Maven Analytics](https://mavenanalytics.io/) for creating this engaging PowerBI course.
