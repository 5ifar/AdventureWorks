# ðŸš² AdventureWorks
This repository serves as my documentation for the AdventureWorks Project.
It was created as a self-learning project for the Udemy course: [Microsoft Power BI Desktop for Business Intelligence](https://www.udemy.com/course/microsoft-power-bi-up-running-with-power-bi-desktop/) by Maven Analytics.

It showcases my competancy with the Microsoft Power BI Desktop application and demonstrates my proficiency in Data - Querying, Modelling & Visualization.

The AdventureWorks Project Report has been created using Microsoft Power BI Desktop.

A special thanks to [Maven Analytics](https://mavenanalytics.io/) for creating this engaging PowerBI course.
